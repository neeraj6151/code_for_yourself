"""
Problem => You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.
If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.

Examples:
Input : s = "tree"
Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]

Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :

e --> 2
r --> 1
t --> 1.

The r and t have same occurrences , so we arrange them by alphabetic order.

Input : s = "raaaajj"
Output : ['a' , 'j', 'r' ]

Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :

a --> 4
j --> 2
r --> 1

Input : s = "bbccddaaa"
Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
